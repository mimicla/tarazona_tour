Tarazona (Zaragoza-Spain) Cathedral Tour - Mobile Web App

Practical info about the Cathedral:

It combines a series of different styles, beginning with early 13th-century Gothic, through its latest manifestations in the 15th century, and then merging into the Renaissance in the 16th century, with certain typical elements of Aragonese Mudejar architecture. It was declared a Historic-Artistic Monument in 1931.
The main entrance is presided by a stonework façade with a large Baroque portico built between 1733 and 1735. The cloister is one of the finest examples of the late Aragonese Mudejar style.
The most interesting element is the complex system of plasterworks covering the windows, largely rebuilt in the last century.
